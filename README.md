# AI-Dictation

**Meeting Transcription with Speaker Diarization**

AI-Dictation is a powerful tool that transcribes audio recordings while identifying different speakers in the conversation. The application leverages state-of-the-art speech recognition models to provide accurate transcriptions with speaker labels.

## Features

- Multi-speaker diarization (speaker identification)
- Automatic speech recognition in 100+ languages
- Translation capability for cross-language understanding
- Speaker identification with custom naming
- Export transcripts as text or SRT format
- Real-time memory usage monitoring
- GPU acceleration support

## Technical Architecture

> **Note**: A detailed architecture diagram would be included here in future updates.

The application integrates several key components in a modular pipeline:

1. **Audio Processing**: Handles various input formats and preprocessing via librosa/torchaudio
2. **Speaker Diarization**: Uses PyAnnote's speaker-diarization-3.1 model to segment audio by speaker
3. **Speech Recognition**: Routes audio segments through the selected ASR model (Whisper/Wav2Vec2/Seamless)
4. **Translation Layer**: For multilingual content, connects to appropriate translation backend
5. **Streamlit UI**: Provides the interactive frontend for all operations

The pipeline uses a segment-based approach rather than processing the entire audio at once, enabling efficient memory usage and precise speaker attribution. Temporary files are managed with unique identifiers to prevent collisions during parallel processing.

## Model Comparison

We've experimented with multiple speech recognition models including Wav2Vec2 and Whisper, finding superior results with OpenAI's Whisper. Research published in [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Comparison-between-the-results-obtained-using-Wav2Vec20-and-Whisper-for-ASR-left-and_fig3_368378522) confirms our experience, showing Whisper consistently outperforming Wav2Vec2 for most speech recognition tasks.

Due to these findings, **Wav2Vec2 will be removed in an upcoming release** to streamline the application and focus on the best performing models.

> **Note on Language Support**: We are actively working on properly mapping supported languages for speech-to-text and text-to-text translation in the code. This will be fixed soon. For the most common languages encountered in US business, speech-to-text and text-to-text translation is already working excellently.

### When to Choose Each Model

| Feature | Whisper | Seamless M4T | Wav2Vec2 |
|---------|---------|--------------|----------|
| Best for general transcription | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ |
| Best for multilingual content | ⚠️ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Best for direct translation | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Processing speed | Fast | Medium | Fast |
| Memory requirements | Moderate | High | Low |
| Punctuation & capitalization | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Language identification | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Handles technical vocabulary | ✅ | ⚠️ | ⚠️ |

- **Whisper**: Choose for most everyday transcription needs, especially when working in a single language or need the best balance of accuracy and speed
- **Seamless M4T**: Choose when working with multiple languages in the same recording or when direct translation is the primary goal
- **Wav2Vec2**: Legacy option, only use if you specifically need uppercase-only output or have compatibility requirements

### Advanced Settings

#### Minimum Segment Duration
- Controls the shortest audio segment that will be transcribed (0.5-5.0 seconds)
- Lower values capture more speech but may introduce more errors
- Higher values focus on longer, more meaningful utterances
- Default (1.5s) works well for most conversations

#### Audio Loading Options
- **Use librosa**: More reliable but slightly slower audio processing
- **Clean temporary files**: Automatically removes temporary files after processing

#### GPU Acceleration
- Enables faster processing on CUDA-compatible GPUs
- Automatically detects available hardware
- Shows real-time memory usage

### Workflow

1. Upload an audio file (WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG)
2. The system identifies different speakers
3. Assign names to each speaker
4. View the complete transcript
5. Translate segments to your preferred language if needed
6. Download the transcript as text or SRT format

## Performance Considerations

- **GPU vs CPU**: Using a GPU dramatically speeds up processing, especially for large files
- **Model Size**: Larger models provide better accuracy but require more memory and processing time
- **File Length**: Longer recordings require more processing time and resources
- **Memory Usage**: The performance meter helps monitor resource utilization
- **Platform-specific considerations**:
  - Seamless M4T performs best on Linux with the native implementation
  - Windows/macOS users may see better performance with Whisper for large files

## Implementation Details

### Speaker Diarization
- Uses PyAnnote's ECAPA-TDNN embedding model with 192 dimensions
- 3.1 version includes improved handling of overlapping speech
- Diarization clustering is performed using agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC)
- Post-processing includes a 0.5s minimum segment duration filter

### ASR Implementation
- Whisper uses CTranslate2 optimized runtime via faster-whisper
- 8-bit quantization for CPU inference, 16-bit float for GPU inference
- Custom segment extraction optimized for speaker-diarized input
- Fallback mechanisms to handle transcription failures
- Context window of 30 seconds for long-form content

### Translation Pipeline
- Two-stage pipeline for unsupported language combinations
- Neural Machine Translation implemented with NLLB-200 distilled models
- Language detection verification to prevent unnecessary translations
- Batching system for efficient processing of multiple segments

## Known Limitations

- **Speaker Diarization**: Performance degrades when speakers have similar voices or with significant background noise
- **Overlapping Speech**: Accuracy drops significantly when multiple people speak simultaneously
- **Domain-specific Terminology**: Technical, medical, or specialized vocabulary may be transcribed incorrectly
- **Heavy Accents**: Non-standard accents can reduce transcription accuracy, particularly with smaller models
- **Very Long Files**: Files exceeding 2 hours may require significant memory and processing time
- **Low-quality Audio**: Recordings with sampling rates below 16kHz or significant compression artifacts show reduced accuracy

## API Usage

While the application is primarily designed with a Streamlit UI, the core functionality can be accessed programmatically:

```python
from dictate import transcribe_whisper_segment, load_diarization_model, load_whisper_model

# Load models
diarization_model = load_diarization_model(use_gpu=True)
whisper_model = load_whisper_model("small", use_gpu=True)

# Process audio file
audio_file = "meeting.wav"

# Perform diarization
diarization_results = diarization_model({"waveform": audio, "sample_rate": 16000})

# Process each segment
for segment, track, speaker in diarization_results.itertracks(yield_label=True):
    start_time = segment.start
    end_time = segment.end
    
    # Transcribe segment
    text, detected_language = transcribe_whisper_segment(
        audio_file, start_time, end_time, whisper_model
    )
    
    print(f"Speaker {speaker} [{start_time:.2f}-{end_time:.2f}]: {text}")
```

See `dictate.py` for additional API functions and parameters.

## Customization Options

### Fine-tuning for Domain-specific Vocabulary

While not included in the UI, advanced users can fine-tune the models for domain-specific vocabulary:

1. For Whisper, see the [OpenAI fine-tuning documentation](https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions/1087)
2. For Seamless M4T, see Meta's [fine-tuning guide](https://github.com/facebookresearch/seamless_communication/tree/main/examples/seamless_m4t_v2)

### Adding Custom Languages

Language support can be extended by:

1. Adding language codes and names to `WHISPER_LANGUAGE_MAP` in `dictate.py`
2. Creating a mapping between language codes for Whisper, Seamless, and NLLB models
3. Testing with sample content to verify compatibility

### Hardware Optimizations

For specialized hardware:

- CUDA optimization settings can be adjusted in the model loading functions
- For ROCm (AMD GPUs), modify the device parameters in the model loading functions
- For Apple Silicon, use MPS as the device for compatible models
